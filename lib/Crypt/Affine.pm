=head1 DESCRIPTION

The affine cipher is a type of mono alphabetic substitution cipher,  wherein each
letter in an alphabet is mapped to its numeric equivalent &  then encrypted using
a  simple  mathematical  function. It inherits the weaknesses of all substitution
ciphers. In  the  affine  cipher  the  letters of an alphabet of size m are first
mapped  to  the  integers in the range 0..m-1. It then uses modular arithmetic to
transform  the  integer  that  each  plaintext letter corresponds to into another
integer  that  correspond to a ciphertext letter.The function for encryption of a
single letter can be defined as below:

E(x) = (mx + r) % l

where  'l'  is the size of the alphabet and 'm' & 'r' are the key  of cipher. The
value 'm' must be choosen such that 'm' and 'l' are coprime.

Similarly the function for decryption of a single letter can be defined as below:

D(x) = (m ^ -1) (x - r) % l

where  (m ^ -1)  is the modular multiplicative inverse of 'm' modulo 'l'  and  it
satisfies the equation below:

m (m ^ -1) % l = 1

has  'r'       => (is => 'ro', isa => $Num,       required => 1 );
has  'reverse' => (is => 'ro', isa => $ZeroOrOne, default => sub { return 0; });
has  'source'  => (is => 'ro', isa => $FilePath);

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

The constructor expects the following parameters as described below in the table:

    +----------+----------+-------------------------------------------------+
    | Key      | Required | Description                                     |
    +----------+----------+-------------------------------------------------+
    |  m       |    Yes   | Any positive number.                            |
    |  r       |    Yes   | Any positive number.                            |
    |  reverse |    No    | 0 or 1, depending whether to use reverse set of |
    |          |          | alphabets. Default is 0.                        |
    |  source  |    No    | Filename with complete path containing comma    |
    |          |          | separated list of alphabets. By default it uses |
    |          |          | A-Z, a-z.                                       |
